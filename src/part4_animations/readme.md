# Part 4: Animations and polish

In this chapter, we will make the game looks a bit more like a game, by adding graphics, animations and some sound effects.

Compared to the previous chapter, only [`game.js`](https://github.com/cstoquer/platformerTutorial/blob/master/src/part4_animations/game.js), [`Level.js`](https://github.com/cstoquer/platformerTutorial/blob/master/src/part4_animations/Level.js) and [`Player.js`](https://github.com/cstoquer/platformerTutorial/blob/master/src/part4_animations/Player.js) has been modifed.

## Adding graphics to the level design
To make levels more beautifull without adding too much complexity, we used a simple trick: we separate level apparence and logic.
A level is made of two TileMaps:
- a `background` map that contains the graphics to display on screen
- a `logic` map that is not rendered, but used as data to determine the type of tiles (solid or empty).

By doing this way, we don't have to specify the type for every sprites in the tilesheet. TileMaps can be layered in the editor to make sure that they align correctly: simply drag the map from the *assets* panel, onto the *map* panel as demonstrated in this animation:

Modifications made to the `Level.js` code are straightforward:

```js
export default class Level {
	constructor() {
		this.logic      = getMap('part4/logic')
		this.background = getMap('part4/background')

		this.width  = this.logic.width  * TILE_WIDTH
		this.height = this.logic.height * TILE_HEIGHT
	}

	render() {
		draw(this.background, 0, 0)
	}

	getTileAt(x, y) {
		x = Math.round(x / TILE_WIDTH)
		y = Math.round(y / TILE_HEIGHT)

		x = clamp(x, 0, this.logic.width  - 1)
		y = clamp(y, 0, this.logic.height - 1)

		var tile = this.logic.get(x, y)
		if (!tile) return EMPTY_TILE
		return SOLID_TILE
	}
}
```

## Make the camera follow the player

We're making the level bigger, and now it doesn't fit in the screen. So we need something to make it scroll and follow the player. Pixelbox engine provides a function `camera(x, y)` to translate the rendering to a position `(x, y)` in pixels. We use this in the `update` function of `game.js`:

```js
update: function () {
	this.player.update()

	cls()
	camera(
		clamp(this.player.positionX - 64, 0, this.level.width  - SCREEN_WIDTH),
		clamp(this.player.positionY - 64, 0, this.level.height - SCREEN_HEIGHT)
	)

	this.level.render()
	this.player.render()
}
```

## Animate player character
We change the white square for a proper sprites animations. We will use sprites `153`, `154`, `155` and `156` from the default spritesheet.

![character sprites](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2462139/86437243-099b8d80-bd3f-11ea-941a-d5cb5fcb6478.png)

Here are the modifications made to the code:

- Added a [`facingLeft`](https://github.com/cstoquer/platformerTutorial/blob/master/src/part4_animations/Player.js#L21) boolean to flip the character depending on the direction it is facing.
- Added [`animFrame`](https://github.com/cstoquer/platformerTutorial/blob/master/src/part4_animations/Player.js#L22) attribute to control the walking animation
- The bounding box has been reduced a bit to match the sprites: `width` is now 6 pixels instead of 8.
- Modified the [`render`](https://github.com/cstoquer/platformerTutorial/blob/master/src/part4_animations/Player.js#L124-L150) method as follow:

The character has 3 states which renders differently:
- **jumping**: if the character goes upward (`velocityY < 0`) we use sprite `154` otherwise sprite `155`.
- **walking**: the character is animated using sprites `154` to `156`.
- **idle**: when the character is not moving, it is rendered with sprite `153`.

```js
render() {
	const x = this.positionX - 1
	const y = this.positionY

	// jumping
	if (!this.onGround) {
		sprite(this.velocityY < 0 ? 154 : 155, x, y, this.facingLeft)
		return
	}

	// walking
	const isWalking = btn.right || btn.left

	if (isWalking) {
		this.animFrame = (this.animFrame + 0.2)
		if (this.animFrame > WALK_ANIMATION_SPRITES.length) {
			sfx('footsteps')
			this.animFrame = this.animFrame % WALK_ANIMATION_SPRITES.length
		}
		const animationFrame = Math.floor(this.animFrame)
		sprite(WALK_ANIMATION_SPRITES[animationFrame], x, y, this.facingLeft)
		return
	}

	// idle
	sprite(153, x, y, this.facingLeft)
}
```

## Adding sound effects

We also added a few `sfx` commands to play sounds when the character walks, jumps and lands. Sounds are made with *Bleeper*. To open Bleeper editor, from the top menu: `View > Bleeper SFX editor`.
